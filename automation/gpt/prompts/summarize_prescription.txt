Extract structured data from this prescription file.
Give your answer as yaml.
The yaml file should have the following format (example below)

```yaml
title: "Prescription - supplements|medication|diet"
issued_by: "Dr. Smith"
sample_date: "2021-01-09"
prescriptions:
- name: "Restrictive diet"
  type: "diet"
  items:
  - "No sugar"
  - "No gluten"
  - "Low corn"
  start_date: "2021-01-09"
  dosage_frequency: "N/A"
- name: "Vitamin drops"
  type: "vitamin"
  items:
  - "Vitamin D3 3000 IU"
  - "Vitamin A 1500 IU"
  - "Mixed tocopherols 50 mg"
  - "Vitamin E 50 IU"
  - "Vitamin K2 20 mcg"
  start_date: "2021-01-09"
  dosage_frequency: "5 drops/day"
```

And here's what the fields mean:

All fields are required.
If there is an unknown value, just put "Unknown" or "N/A" in that field.
