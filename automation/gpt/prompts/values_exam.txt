Summarize this exam and give your answer in yaml format.
Extract structured data from this exam.
Give your answer as yaml.
The yaml file should have the following format (example below)

```yaml
title: "Blood Culture"
requested_by: "Dr. Smith"
sample_date: "2021-01-09"
results:
- metric: "Creatinine"
  material: "blood"
  result: 0.37
  result_unit: "mg/dL"
  reference_range_min: 0.18
  reference_range_max: 0.49
  result_status: "Normal"
  observations: "Normal"
- metric: "Calcium"
  material: "blood"
  result: 9.6
  result_unit: "mg/dL"
  reference_range_min: 9.5
  reference_range_max: 10.8
  result_status: "Normal"
  observations: "Normal"
```

And here's what the fields mean:

* sample_date: the date the exam was taken
* requested_by: who requested the exam
* results: individual result objects
* results.metric: what this particular result is measuring
* results.material: biological material used (blood|urine|stool|DNA|saliva|etc)
* results.result: the result of the exam. Prefer numbers if possible, otherwise use strings.
* results.result_unit: the unit of the result
* results.result_status: one of "Normal", "Abnormal", "High", "Low", "Indeterminate"
* results.reference_range_min: Minimum value of the reference range
* results.reference_range_max: Maximum value of the reference range
* results.observations: Observations about the result or the result in relation to the reference range. (Use longer text only if additional clarification is needed)

All fields are required.
If there is an unknown value, just put "Unknown" or "N/A" in that field.
Important: the yaml content must be in english.
