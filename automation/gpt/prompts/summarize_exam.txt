Summarize this exam and give your answer in yaml format.
The yaml file should have the following format:

```yaml
sample_date: "2021-01-01"
requested_by: "Dr. Smith"
metrics:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
purpose:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
resultSummary:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
abnormalValues:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
normalValues:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
assessmentSummary:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
gptInterpretation:
- "item1"
- "item2"
- "etc"
```

And here's what the fields mean:

* sample_date: the date the exam was taken
* requested_by: who requested the exam
* metrics: what is this exam measuring
* purpose: what is it for
* resultSummary: what was foun in the results
* abnormalValues: what measurements were found outside the reference range
* normalValues: what measurements were found inside the reference range
* assessmentSummary: A summary of the exam assessment, if present
* gptInterpretation: Your own interpretation of what this exam means for the patient

All fields are required.
If there is an unknown value, just put "Unknown" in that field.
The fields with "item1, item2, etc" is so that you organize the information in bullet points

Important: the yaml content must be in english.
