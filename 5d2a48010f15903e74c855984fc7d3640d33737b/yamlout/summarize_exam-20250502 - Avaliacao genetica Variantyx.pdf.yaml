metrics:
- "Genomic UnityÂ® Pharmacogenomics Analysis"
- "CYP2D6 (*1/*4) Intermediate Metabolizer"
- "CYP2C19 (*1/*17) Rapid Metabolizer"
- "CYP3A5 (*3/*3) Poor Metabolizer"
purpose:
- "Identify common variants associated with drug metabolism and pharmacogenetics response"
resultSummary:
- "Intermediate Metabolizer for several drugs including Eliglustat, Propafenone, Carvedilol"
- "Normal Metabolizer for drugs such as Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam"
- "Rapid Metabolizer for drugs like Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole"
abnormalValues:
- "CYP2D6 Intermediate Metabolizer"
- "CYP3A5 Poor Metabolizer"
normalValues:
- "CYP2C9 Normal Metabolizer"
- "SLCO1B1 Normal Function"
assessmentSummary:
- "The patient's genotype indicates varied drug metabolizing capacities, suggesting personalized medication management."
gptInterpretation:
- "The test indicates the patient has an intermediate metabolizer status for a significant number of medications. This may affect drug efficacy and should be considered in clinical decisions."
- "Rapid metabolizer status for CYP2C19 may lead to faster clearance of drugs metabolized by this enzyme, necessitating dose adjustments."
- "Poor metabolizer status in CYP3A5 suggests that for drugs metabolized by this enzyme, standard doses may be less effective."
