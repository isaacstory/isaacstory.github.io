metrics:
- "Iron"
- "Ferritin"
- "Ultra-sensitive TSH"
- "Free T4"
- "Venous Lactic Acid"
- "Complete Blood Count with Platelets"
- "25 OH Vitamin D"
- "Hemoglobin Electrophoresis"
purpose:
- "Evaluate iron levels"
- "Assess thyroid function"
- "Determine vitamin D levels"
- "Complete blood count for overall health"
- "Metabolic acidosis evaluation"
resultSummary:
- "Iron: 130 µg/dL (within normal range)"
- "Ferritin: 43.5 ng/mL (within normal range)"
- "Ultra-sensitive TSH: 1.97 µUI/mL (within normal range)"
- "Free T4: 1.43 ng/dL (within normal range)"
- "Venous Lactic Acid: 16.7 mg/dL (within normal range)"
- "CBC: Hemoglobin slightly high at 13.6 g/dL, Hematocrit slightly high at 39.8%"
- "25 OH Vitamin D: 43.4 ng/mL (within normal range)"
- "Hemoglobin Electrophoresis: all parameters within normal limits"
abnormalValues:
- "Hemoglobin: 13.6 g/dL (slightly high)"
- "Hematocrit: 39.8% (slightly high)"
normalValues:
- "Iron: 130 µg/dL"
- "Ferritin: 43.5 ng/mL"
- "Ultra-sensitive TSH: 1.97 µUI/mL"
- "Free T4: 1.43 ng/dL"
- "Venous Lactic Acid: 16.7 mg/dL"
- "25 OH Vitamin D: 43.4 ng/mL"
- "Hemoglobin Electrophoresis: Hemoglobin A1 95.4%, Hemoglobin A2 2.7%, Hemoglobin Fetal 1.9%"
assessmentSummary:
- "Most parameters within normal ranges"
- "Slightly elevated levels of Hemoglobin and Hematocrit"
gptInterpretation:
- "Overall, the exam results are within normal ranges, indicating no significant abnormalities."
- "Slightly elevated Hemoglobin and Hematocrit could suggest mild dehydration or a higher than average red blood cell count, which does not appear to be clinically significant in this context."
- "Normal thyroid and vitamin D levels indicate balanced endocrine and metabolic functions."
