purpose:
- "General health evaluation"
- "Nutritional status assessment"
- "Thyroid function assessment"
resultSummary:
- "Ferro 137 µg/dL, within reference range"
- "TSH 2.43 µUI/mL, within reference range"
- "Glucose 105 mg/dL, above reference range"
- "Vitamin B-12 exceeds measurement limits"
abnormalValues:
- "Glucose 105 mg/dL (reference: 70 to 99 mg/dL)"
- "LDL Cholesterol 121 mg/dL (expected: <110 mg/dL)"
- "Transaminase (TGO) 36 U/L (reference: <34 U/L)"
normalValues:
- "TSH 2.43 µUI/mL (range: 0.40 to 5.20 µUI/mL)"
- "Ferro 137 µg/dL (range: 65 to 175 µg/dL)"
- "Vitamin A 0.4 mg/L for age range"
- "GGT 11.4 U/L (range: 9 to 18 U/L)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Results mostly within normal ranges except for some nutritional elements."
- "Mild hyperglycemia noted that may require monitoring."
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient's nutritional intake might be adequate, but vigilance is needed for glucose levels, indicating a pre-diabetic tendency."
- "Monitoring of vitamin B12 is necessary due to excessively high levels, as it may indicate supplementation."
