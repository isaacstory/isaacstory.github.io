metrics:
- "Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (RC-I, RC-II, RC-II+III, RC-IV) activities"
- "Citrate Synthase (CS) enzyme activity"
purpose:
- "Evaluate mitochondrial function in buccal cells"
resultSummary:
- "High citrate synthase activity at 242% of normal mean"
- "RC-IV activity below normal range at 45% of normal mean"
- "RC-I activity within normal range at 54% of normal mean"
- "RC-II activity within normal range at 63% of normal mean"
- "RC-II+III activity below normal range at 19% of normal mean"
abnormalValues:
- "Citrate Synthase: 242% above normal mean"
- "RC-IV: 45% below normal mean"
- "RC-II+III: 19% below normal mean"
normalValues:
- "RC-I: 54% of normal mean"
- "RC-II: 63% of normal mean"
assessmentSummary:
- "Marginally decreased activity of RC-IV"
- "Normal activity of RC-I"
- "Significantly increased citrate synthase activity suggesting compensatory response"
- "Periodic monitoring of mitochondrial enzyme assessment recommended"
gptInterpretation:
- "The test indicates likely mitochondrial dysfunction given the high citrate synthase activity and low RC-IV activity."
- "The significantly high citrate synthase activity may be a compensatory mechanism."
- "Periodic re-evaluation is suggested to monitor mitochondrial function over time."
