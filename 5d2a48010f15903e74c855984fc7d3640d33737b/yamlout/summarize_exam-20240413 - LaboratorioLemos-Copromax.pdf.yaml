requested_by: "Dr Rogerio Rita"
metrics:
- "Color"
- "Consistency"
- "pH"
- "Fat content"
- "Calprotectin"
- "IgA"
- "Zonulin"
- "Other inflammatory markers"
- "Parasitic and fungal presence"
purpose:
- "Evaluation of gastrointestinal health"
- "Detection of inflammation"
- "Assessment of pancreatic function"
- "Screening for infections"
- "Determination of digestion efficiency"
resultSummary:
- "Light brown color"
- "Hard consistency"
- "Characteristic odor"
- "Heterogeneous form"
- "Presence of mucus and undigested muscle fibers"
- "pH of 6.0"
- "Elevated melatonin fecal levels"
- "Increased fecal zonulin, indicating heightened intestinal permeability"
- "Low elastase fecal levels, suggesting pancreatic exocrine insufficiency"
- "Decreased secretory IgA levels"
abnormalValues:
- "High melatonin fecal levels (770 pg/mL)"
- "Elevated zonulin fecal levels (108 ng/mL)"
- "Low fecal elastase (179 mcg/g)"
- "Low secretory IgA levels (6 mg/dL)"
normalValues:
- "Calprotectin levels below 25 mcg/g"
- "Lactoferrin below 7,200 ng/mL"
- "Normal presence of flora"
- "Negative for parasites and fungi"
- "Fat content within normal limits"
assessmentSummary:
- "Evidence of hyperpermeability in the intestinal epithelium"
- "Potential pancreatic insufficiency"
- "Indicators of constipation or obstipation possibly due to muscle hypotonia, mechanical dyskinesia, or parasympathetic hormonal changes"
- "Lack of sufficient mucosal immune defense"
gptInterpretation:
- "The exam suggests intestinal hyperpermeability, potentially leading to immune responses or inflammation."
- "The patient may have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, impacting digestion efficiency."
- "Constipation could be affecting the patient, possibly due to dietary or muscular issues."
- "Further evaluation and potential therapeutic interventions may be required to address these findings."
