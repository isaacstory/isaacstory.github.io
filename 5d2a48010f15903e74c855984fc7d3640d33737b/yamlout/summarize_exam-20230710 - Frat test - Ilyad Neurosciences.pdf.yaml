metrics:
- "Blocking"
- "Binding"
purpose:
- "Measure folate receptor blocking antibody"
- "Measure folate receptor binding antibody"
resultSummary:
- "Blocking: NEGATIVE, Not Detectable pmol blocked per ml"
- "Binding: NEGATIVE, Not Detectable OD Units"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "Blocking: NEGATIVE"
- "Binding: NEGATIVE"
assessmentSummary:
- "Folate receptor blocking antibody not detected."
- "Folate receptor binding antibody not detected."
gptInterpretation:
- "No folate receptor blocking antibody detected, indicating no interference with folic acid binding."
- "No folate receptor binding antibody detected, suggesting no abnormal immune response related to folate receptor."
- "Retesting may be warranted due to potential fluctuations in antibody concentration over time."
