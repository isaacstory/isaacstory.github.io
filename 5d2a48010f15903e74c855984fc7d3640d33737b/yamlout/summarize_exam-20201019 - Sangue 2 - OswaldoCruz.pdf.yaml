purpose:
- Check general health status
- Screen for inborn metabolic errors
- Assess lipid levels
- Evaluate cardiac function
- Screen for thyroid disorders
- Determine vitamin levels
- Analyze chromosomal abnormalities
resultSummary:
- Blood gas parameters within normal range except O2 saturation
- Normal hemogram except high hemoglobin and hematocrit
- Positive sugars in urine
- Elevated total cholesterol and LDL
- High potassium levels
- Elevated Vitamin B12
- Normal T3, T4, and thyroid levels
- Normal karyotype with pericentric inversion in chromosome 9
abnormalValues:
- "Saturation of O2: 41.0% (Reference: 55.0-75.0%)"
- "Hemoglobin: 13.6 g/dL (Reference: 10.5-13.5 g/dL)"
- "Hematocrit: 39.8% (Reference: 33.0-39.0%)"
- "Positive sugar in urine (Reference: Negative)"
- "Total Cholesterol: 184 mg/dL (No reference for this age)"
- "LDL Cholesterol: 121 mg/dL (Reference: <110 mg/dL)"
- "Potassium: 5.4 mEq/L (Reference: 3.3-4.6 mEq/L)"
- "Vitamin B-12: Superior to 2000 pg/mL (Reference: 197-771 pg/mL)"

- Erythrocytes
- MCV
- MCH
- MCHC
- RDW
- Leukocytes and Differential Count
- Platelet Count
- Urea
- Creatinine
- Triglycerides
- HDL
- VLDL
- Lipid Total
- CK Mass
- TSH
- T3 free
- T4 free
- 25 OH Vitamin D
- Karyotype Interpretation: Normal variation
assessmentSummary:
- Most parameters are within the normal ranges.
- Elevated Hemoglobin and Hematocrit suggest possible dehydration or polycythemia.
- Positive sugar in urine indicates glycosuria, which needs further investigation for causes such as a metabolic disorder.
- Elevated LDL cholesterol raises concerns for future cardiovascular risk.
- High potassium level could indicate issues with renal function or adrenal glands.
- Elevated Vitamin B-12 levels are uncommon and might need re-evaluation or a check for supplementation.
- Normal chromosomal variation with no detected pathology.
gptInterpretation:
- The overall health status appears normal with specific areas needing follow-up.
- Glycosuria should be rechecked and potential metabolic disorders ruled out.
- Elevated LDL and cholesterol call for dietary review and potential lifestyle changes for cardiovascular health.
- High potassium should be monitored and renal function assessed.
- The significant discrepancy of Vitamin B-12 levels necessitates a re-test and review of patient supplementation.
