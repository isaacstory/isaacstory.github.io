sample_date: "2022-11-22"
requested_by: "Dr. Cristiane Borges Barra Moura"
metrics:
  - "Bone density"
  - "Joint spaces"
  - "Bone age"
purpose:
  - "Evaluate bone density"
  - "Assess joint spaces"
  - "Determine bone age"
resultSummary:
  - "Bone structures have conserved radiographic density"
  - "Joint spaces are conserved"
  - "Approximate bone age is 3 years and 6 months (Greulich-Pyle method)"
abnormalValues:
  - "None found"
normalValues:
  - "Bone density"
  - "Joint spaces"
  - "Bone age"
assessmentSummary:
  - "Bone density and joint spaces are normal for patient"
  - "Bone age is consistent with expected growth for the patient"
gptInterpretation:
  - "The patient shows normal bone density and joint space preservation"
  - "Bone age is appropriate for the patient's chronological age with no abnormalities detected"
