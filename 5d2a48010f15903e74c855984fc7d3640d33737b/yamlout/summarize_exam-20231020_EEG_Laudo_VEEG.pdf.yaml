title: "EEG - Laudo VEEG"
material: "brain waves"
sample_date: "2023-10-20"
requested_by: "Unknown"
metrics:
- "Brain electrical activity"
purpose:
- "To monitor electrical activity during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep"
resultSummary:
- "Normal baseline activity"
- "Theta and beta waves in other brain regions during wakefulness"
- "Diffuse slowing of the trace during drowsiness"
- "Habitual physiological elements during sleep"
- "No epileptiform paroxysms observed"
- "No electrographic seizures recorded"
- "No abnormal responses to intermittent photic stimulation"
abnormalValues:
- "None observed"
normalValues:
- "Normal baseline activity"
assessmentSummary:
- "12-hour Video-EEG with patient in wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep demonstrating normal baseline activity, absence of epileptiform abnormalities, and absence of electrographic seizures"
gptInterpretation:
- "The EEG results show normal brain electrical activity without signs of epilepsy or seizures."
- "The patient does not present any abnormal brain waves or responses that would indicate a neurological disorder based on this EEG monitoring session."
- "This examination suggests typical brain function during different states of consciousness."
