assessmentSummary:
- "The majority of the urinalysis results are within normal ranges, indicating no signs of infection or significant proteinuria."
- "Abnormal albumin/creatinine ratio suggests potential issues with kidney function."
gptInterpretation:
- "The normal values in the urinalysis generally indicate good urinary tract health without infections."
- "However, low urinary creatinine and high albumin/creatinine ratio may indicate early signs of kidney dysfunction or other renal issues."
