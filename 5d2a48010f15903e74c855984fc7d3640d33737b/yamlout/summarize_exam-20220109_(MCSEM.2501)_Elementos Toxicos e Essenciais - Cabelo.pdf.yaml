title: "Hair - Toxic and essential elements"
material: "hair"
sample_date: "2022-01-09"
requested_by: "Dr Rogerio Rita"
metrics:
- "Toxic Metals (e.g., Aluminum, Silver, Tin)"
- "Essential Elements (e.g., Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc)"
- "Proportions of Elements (e.g., Ca/Mg ratio)"
purpose:
- "Identify excess, deficiency, or imbalance of elements"
- "Detect potential environmental or physiological exposure to toxic metals"
- "Assess nutritional status via essential elements"
resultSummary:
- "Elevated toxic metals: Aluminum, Silver, Tin"
- "Low levels of essential elements: Copper, Zinc, Chromium, Selenium"
- "Ca/Mg ratio within normal range"
abnormalValues:
- "Aluminum: 18 µg/g (Reference: <8.0)"
- "Silver: 0.32 µg/g (Reference: <0.20)"
- "Tin: 0.33 µg/g (Reference: <0.30)"
- "Copper: 7.8 µg/g (Reference: 11-18)"
- "Zinc: 72 µg/g (Reference: 100-190)"
- "Chromium: 0.38 µg/g (Reference: 0.43-0.80)"
- "Selenium: 0.50 µg/g (Reference: 0.70-1.10)"
normalValues:
- "Mercury: 0.29 µg/g (Reference: <0.40)"
- "Lead: 0.41 µg/g (Reference: <1.0)"
- "Calcium: 257 µg/g (Reference: 125-370)"
- "Magnesium: 30 µg/g (Reference: 12-30)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Elevated aluminum, possibly linked to neurotoxic effects"
- "High silver and tin suggest environmental exposure"
- "Deficiencies in zinc, copper, selenium, and chromium may impact immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic health"
- "No external contamination reported; results are reliable"
gptInterpretation:
- "The elevated aluminum, silver, and tin levels suggest environmental exposure that may affect cognitive and systemic health."
- "Low levels of zinc, copper, and selenium might contribute to weakened immune response and metabolic issues."
- "The nutritional deficiencies and toxic metal exposure should be addressed through dietary interventions and source identification for toxic elements."
