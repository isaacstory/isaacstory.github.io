assessmentSummary:
- "The examination results indicate a possible infection and impaired kidney function with associated inflammation."
gptInterpretation:
- "The elevated leukocytes suggest an active infection, possibly bacterial."
- "Increased creatinine and urea levels may signal decreased kidney function, which could be acute or chronic."
- "The high levels of C-reactive protein are consistent with an inflammatory response, which could be related to the infection or another inflammatory condition."
