assessmentSummary:
- "No growth of pathogenic bacteria in urine culture"
- "Mild urinary anomalies detected: turbidity, presence of ketone bodies, and amorphous urates"
gptInterpretation:
- "The negative urine culture indicates no bacterial infection"
- "Turbid appearance and presence of ketone bodies might suggest dehydration or metabolic anomaly"
- "Presence of amorphous urates can be due to dietary factors or mild dehydration"
