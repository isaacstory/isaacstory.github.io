requested_by: "Rogério Rogério Rita"
metrics:
- "Genomic variants"
- "Pharmacogenomic metabolizer status"
- "Gene-drug associations"
purpose:
- "Identify common variants associated with drug metabolism and pharmacogenetics response"
- "Provide gene-drug associations according to the FDA Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations"
resultSummary:
- "Identified pharmacogenomic variants in 13 genes"
- "Determined metabolizer status for various drugs"
abnormalValues:
- "CYP2D6 (*1/*4) - Intermediate Metabolizer"
- "CYP4F2 (*1/*1) - Indeterminate"
- "VKORC1 Reference/Reference - Indeterminate"
normalValues:
- "DPYD c.85T>C (*9A)/c.1896T>C - Normal Metabolizer"
- "NUDT15 (*1/*1) - Normal Metabolizer"
- "SLCO1B1 (*1/*14) - Normal Function"
- "TPMT (*1/*1) - Normal Metabolizer"
- "UGT1A1 (*1/*36) - Normal Metabolizer"
- "CYP2C19 (*1/*17) - Rapid Metabolizer"
assessmentSummary:
- "This test provides insight into how genetic variants may affect drug metabolism but does not diagnose health conditions."
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient has various metabolizer statuses, indicating differences in how they might process specific medications."
- "Intermediate metabolizer status may lead to altered drug efficacy for certain medications and may require adjustments."
- "Identifying the metabolizer status can help in customizing drug prescriptions to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects."
