metrics:
- "IgG reactivity to 190 foods"
purpose:
- "To identify IgG-mediated immune responses to various food antigens"
resultSummary:
- "High reactivity: Cashew nut, Miso"
- "Moderate reactivity: Egg white, Peanut"
- "Low reactivity: Beta-Lactoglobulin, Casein, Cow's milk, Pea, Hazelnut, Pineapple, Soybean"
abnormalValues:
- "Cashew nut: 19.43 MFI x 1000"
- "Miso: 30.03 MFI x 1000"
- "Egg white: 11.99 MFI x 1000"
- "Peanut: 13.33 MFI x 1000"
- "Hazelnut: 8.63 MFI x 1000"
- "Soybean: 6.50 MFI x 1000"
- "Pineapple: 5.46 MFI x 1000"
- "Beta-Lactoglobulin: 5.73 MFI x 1000"
- "Cow's milk: 5.20 MFI x 1000"
- "Casein: 4.80 MFI x 1000"
normalValues:
- "Numerous foods showing low or no significant IgG reactivity below 4.47 MFI x 1000"
assessmentSummary:
- "The patient exhibits IgG-mediated immune response to several foods, indicating potential sensitivities."
- "High and moderate reactivities particularly suggest a need to avoid these foods to mitigate symptoms."
gptInterpretation:
- "The test results suggest the patient has significant immune reactions to certain foods, especially cashew nuts, miso, egg white, and peanuts."
- "Avoiding high and moderate reactivity foods may help in reducing symptoms like digestive issues, skin conditions, or other inflammation-related symptoms."
- "A rotating diet plan can be beneficial to prevent new sensitivities and manage current immune reactivity."
