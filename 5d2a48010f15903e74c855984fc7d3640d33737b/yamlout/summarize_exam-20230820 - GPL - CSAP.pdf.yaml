metrics:
- "GI Pathogen Profile"
- "Parasitology"
- "Stool Chemistries"
- "Bacteriology Culture"
- "Viruses"
- "Pathogenic Bacteria"
purpose:
- "To assess gastrointestinal health"
- "To identify potential pathogens"
- "To evaluate for parasitic infections"
- "To analyze stool chemistry"
resultSummary:
- "Negative for common GI pathogens"
- "Negative for parasitic infections using Multiplex PCR and Microscopy"
- "Low stool pH (5.5)"
- "Elevated Lysozyme (800 ng/mL)"
- "Detected dysbiotic bacteria: 3+ Citrobacter freundii complex, 2+ Klebsiella/Raoultella complex"
- "Detected commensal bacteria imbalance"
- "Detected beneficial bacteria including 4+ Bacteroides family and 4+ Bifidobacterium family"
abnormalValues:
- "pH of 5.5 (lower than normal range of 5.8-7.0)"
- "Lysozyme at 800 ng/mL (higher than normal range ≤ 500 ng/mL)"
normalValues:
- "Lactoferrin at 2.0 µg/mL (normal range < 7.3 µg/mL)"
- "Calprotectin <10 µg/g (normal range < 80 µg/g)"
- "Secretory IgA at 51.8 mg/dL (normal range 30-275 mg/dL)"
- "Occult Blood: Negative"
- "Soft stool consistency"
- "Brown stool color"
assessmentSummary:
- "Presence of dysbiotic bacteria such as Citrobacter freundii complex suggests a dysbiotic condition."
- "Low pH indicates rapid transit time, potentially due to diarrhea or food intolerance."
- "Elevated Lysozyme suggests inflammatory immune response possibly due to enteropathogens."
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient exhibits a gastrointestinal imbalance with signs of dysbiosis, potentially related to diet or infection."
- "Low pH and elevated Lysozyme are indicative of an inflammatory condition that may need further investigation."
- "The patient may benefit from dietary modifications, including increased fiber intake and potentially probiotics to restore beneficial flora."
- "Further clinical correlation with symptoms and possible re-evaluation in a few weeks may be necessary to monitor changes."
