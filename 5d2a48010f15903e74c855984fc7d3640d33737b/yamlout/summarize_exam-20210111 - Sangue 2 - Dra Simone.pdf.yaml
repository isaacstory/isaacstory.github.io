title: "Blood exam"
material: "blood"
sample_date: "2021-01-11"
requested_by: "Dra Simone Pires"
metrics:
- "Detection of C677T variant in MTHFR gene"
- "Detection of A1298C variant in MTHFR gene"
purpose:
- "To determine the presence of MTHFR gene variants C677T and A1298C"
resultSummary:
- "C677T variant: Absent"
- "A1298C variant: Present in heterozygous form"
abnormalValues:
- "A1298C variant: Present in heterozygous form"
normalValues:
- "C677T variant: Absent"
assessmentSummary:
- "The patient is homozygous CC for C677T and heterozygous AC for A1298C."
- "These results align with established population frequencies."
gptInterpretation:
- "The absence of the C677T variant and the presence of the A1298C variant in a heterozygous form suggest a normal genetic variation without significant clinical implications based on current studies."
- "Recent studies indicate no relationship between these polymorphisms and the risk of venous thrombosis."
