requested_by: "Dr. Rog√©rio Rodrigues Rita"
metrics:
- "Complete blood count"
- "Ferritin"
- "Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride)"
- "Liver Enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT)"
- "Lipid Profile (HDL, LDL, Triglycerides)"
- "Hormone Levels (TSH, Free T4)"
purpose:
- "To assess overall health status"
- "To check for any potential deficiencies or excesses in key blood components"
- "To investigate possible liver function and thyroid function abnormalities"
resultSummary:
- "All measured components were within normal reference range except non-HDL cholesterol"
- "Non-HDL cholesterol might indicate a risk for cardiovascular disease"
abnormalValues:
- "Non-HDL Cholesterol: 124 mg/dL (Intermediary risk range, reference less than 120 mg/dL)"
normalValues:
- "Ferritin: 50 mcg/L (normal)"
- "Sodium: 144 mEq/L (normal)"
- "Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L (normal)"
- "Chloride: 107 mEq/L (upper normal limit)"
- "AST: 32 U/L (normal)"
- "ALT: 15 U/L (normal)"
- "TSH: 3.8 mUI/L (normal)"
- "Free T4: 1.8 ng/dL (normal for age)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Comprehensive assessment of general health with focus on blood, liver, lipid, and thyroid metrics"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient's exam results are mostly within normal limits, indicating good general health."
- "Non-HDL cholesterol is at an intermediary level, suggesting the need for lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risks."
