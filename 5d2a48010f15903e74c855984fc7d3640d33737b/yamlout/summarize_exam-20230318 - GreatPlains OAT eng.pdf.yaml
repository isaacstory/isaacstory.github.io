requested_by: "Dr. Dane Fliedner"
metrics:
- "Metabolic Markers in Urine"
- "Oxalate Metabolites"
- "Glycolytic Cycle Metabolites"
- "Mitochondrial Markers - Krebs Cycle Metabolites"
- "Neurotransmitter Metabolites"
- "Indicators of Detoxification"
- "Amino Acid Metabolites"
purpose:
- "Evaluate metabolic and nutritional profile"
resultSummary:
- "High yeast/fungal metabolites indicating a yeast/fungal overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract"
- "High hippuric acid possibly from food, GI bacterial activity, or exposure to toluene"
- "High HPHPA suggesting abnormal phenylalanine metabolism due to Clostridium bacteria"
- "Low citric acid possibly indicating impaired Krebs cycle function or other deficiencies"
- "Low homovanillic acid (HVA) indicative of low dopamine production or metabolism"
abnormalValues:
- "High Oxalate Metabolites (Glyceric, Glycolic, Oxalic)"
- "High Succinic, Fumaric, Malic, 2-Oxoglutaric, Aconitic, Citric"
- "High Pyroglutamic, 2-Hydroxybutyric"
- "High Hippuric, 4-Hydroxybenzoic"
normalValues:
- "Lactic acid"
- "Pyruvic acid"
- "3-Methylglutaric"
- "2-Hydroxyisovaleric"
- "Phenylpyruvic"
assessmentSummary:
- "Yeast/fungal overgrowth requires antifungal treatment and probiotics"
- "High HPHPA linked to behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms"
- "Low citric acid suggests possible metabolic or dietary deficiencies"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient shows signs of yeast/fungal overgrowth in the GI tract."
- "Abnormal phenylalanine metabolism likely due to Clostridium bacterial activity."
- "Low levels of neurotransmitter metabolites indicate potential deficiencies in dopamine and serotonin metabolism."
- "Impaired Krebs cycle function may suggest deeper metabolic issues or nutritional deficits."
