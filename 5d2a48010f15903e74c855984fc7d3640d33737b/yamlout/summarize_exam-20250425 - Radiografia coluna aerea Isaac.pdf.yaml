requested_by: "Dr. Monica Elisabeth Simons Guerra"
metrics:
- "Digital radiograph of cavum air column"
- "Digital radiograph of facial sinuses"
- "Digital chest radiograph"
purpose:
- "Assess hypertrophy in nasopharyngeal area"
- "Evaluate transparency of maxillary sinuses"
- "Examine thoracic structure and lung condition"
resultSummary:
- "Hypertrophy of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx causing narrowing of the air column"
- "Slight peripheral hypotransparency of the maxillary sinuses, other air cavities normal"
- "Dorsal scoliotic attitude with right convexity"
- "Cardiac silhouette normal"
- "No significant mediastinal widening"
- "Diffuse mild pulmonary hyperinflation, clear costophrenic angles"
abnormalValues:
- "Hypertrophy of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx"
- "Slight peripheral hypotransparency of the maxillary sinuses"
- "Dorsal scoliotic attitude"
normalValues:
- "Conserved bone density"
- "Cardiac silhouette within normal limits"
- "Normal transparency of paranasal sinuses"
- "No mediastinal widening"
- "No nodular formations or intraparenchymal consolidations"
- "Aorta and pulmonary vascularization without alterations"
- "Clear costophrenic angles"
assessmentSummary:
- "Presence of nasopharyngeal hypertrophy"
- "No significant pathologies in chest area"
gptInterpretation:
- "The nasopharyngeal hypertrophy may indicate potential respiratory obstruction issues."
- "The slight hypotransparency in the maxillary sinuses suggests mild sinus issues."
- "Overall, the chest x-ray indicates normal cardiac and pulmonary conditions."
