metrics:
- "Albuminuria"
- "Urinalysis Type I"
- "Urinary Creatinine"
- "Albumin/Creatinine Ratio"
purpose:
- "Screening for diabetic nephropathy"
- "General urinalysis for kidney function"
resultSummary:
- "23.00 mg/L microalbuminuria"
- "Urine Density: 1.017"
- "pH: 7.5"
- "Urinary Creatinine: 337.90 mg/L"
- "Albumin/Creatinine Ratio: 68.07 mg/g"
- "All other parameters within normal range"
abnormalValues:
- "Albumin/Creatinine Ratio: 68.07 mg/g (Normal: <30 mg/g)"
normalValues:
- "Urinary Albumin: 23.00 mg/L (Normal: <30 mg/L)"
- "Urine Density: 1.017 (Normal: 1.005 to 1.030)"
- "pH: 7.5 (Normal: 5.0 to 8.0)"
- "Proteins: Negative"
- "Glucose: Negative"
- "Ketone Bodies: Negative"
- "Bile Pigments: Negative"
- "Urobilinogen: 0.2 mg/dL (Normal: <1.0 mg/dL)"
- "Nitrite: Negative"
- "Hemoglobin: Absent"
- "Leukocytes: <10,000/mL (Normal: <10,000/mL)"
- "RBCs: <10,000/mL (Normal: <10,000/mL)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Elevated urinary albumin to creatinine ratio indicates potential early diabetic nephropathy"
- "All other urinalysis parameters are within normal range"
gptInterpretation:
- "The elevated albumin/creatinine ratio suggests early signs of kidney damage, which is a common complication of diabetes."
- "Further monitoring and possibly additional tests are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy."
- "Despite the concerning albumin/creatinine ratio, the presence of normal values in the rest of the urinalysis is reassuring."
