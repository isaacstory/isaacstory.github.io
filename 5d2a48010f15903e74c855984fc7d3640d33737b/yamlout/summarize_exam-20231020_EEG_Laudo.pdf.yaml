title: "EEG - Laudo"
material: "brain waves"
sample_date: "2023-10-20"
requested_by: "Unknown"
metrics:
- "brain electrical activity"
- "response to photo-stimulation"
- "sleep stages"
purpose:
- "assess baseline brain activity"
- "detect epileptiform activity"
- "monitor electric brain activity during sleep"
resultSummary:
- "normal baseline activity"
- "8 to 9 Hz posterior rhythm during wakefulness"
- "theta and beta waves in other regions"
- "diffuse slowing during drowsiness"
- "normal sleep-related elements"
- "no epileptiform paroxysms"
- "no electrographic seizures"
- "no abnormal responses to photo-stimulation"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "baseline brain activity"
- "posterior rhythm during wakefulness"
- "theta and beta waves in other regions"
- "diffuse slowing during drowsiness"
- "normal sleep-related elements"
assessmentSummary:
- "12-hour video-EEG shows normal baseline activity"
- "no epileptiform abnormalities"
- "no electrographic seizures"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient shows normal brain activity with no signs of epileptiform activity or seizures over a 12-hour monitoring period."
- "All observed brain activity during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep falls within normal limits."
