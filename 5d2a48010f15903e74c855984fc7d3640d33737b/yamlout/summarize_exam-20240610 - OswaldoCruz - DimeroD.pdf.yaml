requested_by: "Dr. Rogerio Rodrigues Rita"
metrics:
- "D-dimer Quantitative"
purpose:
- "To evaluate potential thromboembolic processes"
resultSummary:
- "D-dimer Quantitative: 270 ng/mL FEU"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "D-dimer Quantitative: 270 ng/mL FEU (Reference: Below 500 ng/mL FEU)"
assessmentSummary:
- "The high negative predictive value of the test excludes thromboembolic processes."
gptInterpretation:
- "The D-dimer level is within normal reference limits, reducing concern for thromboembolic conditions."
