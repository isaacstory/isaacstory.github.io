metrics:
- "Detection of Clostridium difficile Toxins A and B"
purpose:
- "To investigate the presence of Clostridium difficile toxins in fecal samples"
resultSummary:
- "Negative for Clostridium difficile Toxins A and B"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "Negative for Clostridium difficile Toxins A and B"
assessmentSummary:
- "The test results for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B were negative. However, the immunoassay method used has approximately 50% sensitivity. If there is a persistent suspicion of Clostridium difficile infection, a PCR test is recommended for higher sensitivity and specificity."
gptInterpretation:
- "The negative result suggests that the patient does not have a Clostridium difficile infection, although the test's low sensitivity means that a false negative is possible. In case of continued symptoms or strong clinical suspicion, further testing with a PCR method is advisable for accurate detection."
