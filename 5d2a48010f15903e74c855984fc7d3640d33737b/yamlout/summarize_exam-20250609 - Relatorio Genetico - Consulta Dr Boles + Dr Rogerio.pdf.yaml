metrics:
- "Nuclear-DNA variants"
- "Mitochondrial-DNA variants"
- "Structural & repeat variants"
- "Chromosomal microarray"
purpose:
- "Comprehensive genetic analysis for Isaac"
- "Identify actionable genetic variants"
- "Assess mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms"
- "Guide targeted therapeutic interventions"
resultSummary:
- "Multiple clinically relevant genetic variants identified across nuclear and mitochondrial DNA"
- "SLC22A5 de novo mutation affects carnitine transport and energy availability"
- "TRAP1 variant impairs mitochondrial stress protection"
- "SCN9A variant causes overactive pain/heat sensors"
- "Mitochondrial tRNA mutations contribute to cellular stress"
abnormalValues:
- "SLC22A5 c.254_264dupGGCTCGCCACC (de novo) - Pathogenic variant affecting carnitine transport, requires L-carnitine supplementation"
- "TRAP1 c.1163G>A (paternal) - Probable splice-site variant impairing mitochondrial stress protection, requires antioxidant support (CoQ10, alpha-lipoic acid, NAC)"
- "SCN9A c.2190G>C (paternal) - Overactive pain/heat sensors causing meltdowns/poor sleep, consider sodium channel blockers (lidocaine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine)"
- "MED13 (paternal) - Gene expression regulator linked to ASD, not directly actionable but justifies neurodevelopmental therapies"
- "MT-TT m.15929A>G (maternal) - Rare tRNA mutation reducing mitochondrial protein production, adds to mitochondrial stress"
- "MT-ND1 m.3397A>G (maternal) - Seen in neurological conditions, likely benign in Isaac's case"
- "Chromosome 3q deletion (paternal) - Includes NAALADL2 deletion, VUS requiring monitoring"
- "CACNA1A repeat contraction - May relate to migraines/ataxia, unclear relevance for Isaac"
normalValues:
- "No highly pathogenic single variants identified as sole disease cause"
- "MT-ND1 variant likely benign in Isaac's case"
assessmentSummary:
- "Disease mechanism appears polygenic with mitochondrial dysfunction as central theme"
- "Multiple actionable variants identified requiring targeted interventions"
- "Carnitine supplementation indicated for SLC22A5 variant"
- "Mitochondrial support protocol recommended for TRAP1 variant"
- "Pain management strategies needed for SCN9A variant"
- "Continued neurodevelopmental support justified by MED13 findings"
gptInterpretation:
- "Isaac's condition results from multiple genetic variants working together"
- "Primary focus should be on mitochondrial support and energy metabolism"
- "Pain sensitivity management crucial for behavioral improvements"
- "Genetic findings provide clear therapeutic targets and justify current interventions"
- "Regular monitoring needed for variants of uncertain significance"
