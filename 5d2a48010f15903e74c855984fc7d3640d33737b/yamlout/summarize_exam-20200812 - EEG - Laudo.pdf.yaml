title: "EEG"
material: "brain waves"
sample_date: "2020-08-12"
requested_by: "Dra Simone Pires"
metrics:
- "Brain wave activity"
purpose:
- "Evaluate brain function during induced sleep"
- "Check for pathologic EEG patterns"
- "Assess brain symmetry"
resultSummary:
- "No pathological graphoelements recorded"
- "No persistent asymmetry between homologous areas"
- "Predominance of Delta band in Fz Cz Pz"
- "Predominance of Theta band in Cz"
- "Predominance of Alpha band in Cz"
- "Predominance of Beta 1 band in Cz"
- "Diffused predominance of Beta 2 and Beta 3 bands"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "Brain activity formed by theta and delta waves with variable voltages"
- "No persistent asymmetry between homologous areas"
- "Average amplitude spectra between homologous areas showed no asymmetry"
- "Unimodal distribution with increased delta rhythm in all brain regions"
assessmentSummary:
- "Digital EEG in induced sleep within normal parameters"
- "Quantitative EEG (Brain mapping) in induced sleep within normal parameters"
gptInterpretation:
- "The EEG results suggest normal brain function during induced sleep in the 1-year-old patient."
- "No abnormalities such as pathological graphoelements or asymmetry were detected."
- "The distribution of brain activity is consistent with normal sleep patterns for the child's age."
