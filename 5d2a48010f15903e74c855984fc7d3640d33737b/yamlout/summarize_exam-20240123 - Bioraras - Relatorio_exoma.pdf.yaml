requested_by: "Dr. Tony Callleri Fran√ßa"
metrics:
- "DNA sequence variants"
purpose:
- "Diagnose potential genetic causes for developmental delay, TEA, metabolic acidosis, and gastrointestinal disturbances"
resultSummary:
- "One pathogenic variant in the GALT gene associated with Galactosemia"
- "Six variants of uncertain significance in the MED13, ASS1, TAT, DLGAP1, and FHL1 genes"
abnormalValues:
- "Variant in GALT gene (rs111033690) classified as pathogenic"
normalValues:
- "No pathogenic variants found to explain the clinical condition"
assessmentSummary:
- "The patient did not have any pathogenic variants that correlate with the clinical symptoms described"
- "Multiple variants of uncertain significance were identified"
gptInterpretation:
- "The identified pathogenic variant in the GALT gene may contribute to Galactosemia, which typically presents with symptoms like cataracts, cirrhosis, vomiting, diarrhea, developmental delays, and hemolytic anemia."
- "The variants of uncertain significance should be interpreted with caution and do not conclusively explain the patient's clinical condition."
- "Genetic counseling and clinical correlation are essential for a comprehensive understanding of these findings."
