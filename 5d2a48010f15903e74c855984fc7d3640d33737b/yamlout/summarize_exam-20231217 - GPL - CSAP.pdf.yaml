assessmentSummary:
  - The assessment indicates an abnormal increase in lysozyme levels, which is a biomarker of inflammatory immune response in the intestines. This could be associated with the growth of enteropathogens, such as yeasts, dysbiotic, or pathogenic bacteria. High lysozyme levels may also indicate Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, moderate elevations can often be corrected with the elimination of an aggressive enteroinvasive microorganism.

gptInterpretation: "The test results suggest mostly normal digestive and absorption functions, with no significant presence of pathogens, abnormal inflammation markers, or immune response indicators, except for an elevated lysozyme level. The elevated lysozyme indicates a potential inflammatory response possibly due to an enteropathogen. Further investigation and possibly repeat testing of inflammatory markers like calprotectin and lactoferrin in about four weeks may be necessary to evaluate if the inflammatory response persists. Managing this would likely involve addressing any existing infections or inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract."
