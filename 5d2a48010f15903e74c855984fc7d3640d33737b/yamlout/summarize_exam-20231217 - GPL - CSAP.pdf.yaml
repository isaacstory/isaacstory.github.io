material: "stool"
sample_date: "2023-12-17"
requested_by: "Dr Rogerio Rita"
metrics:
- "Elastase"
- "Fat Stain"
- "Carbohydrates"
- "Lactoferrin"
- "Calprotectin"
- "Lysozyme"
- "Secretory IgA"
- "Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)"
- "pH"
- "Occult Blood"
- "Macroscopic Appearance (Color, Consistency)"
purpose:
- "Assess digestive and absorptive function"
- "Evaluate inflammation"
- "Check immunologic markers"
- "Analyze intestinal health markers"
- "Detect pathogens and parasites"
resultSummary:
- "Elastase: 280 µg/g (normal)"
- "Fat Stain: Not Detected"
- "Carbohydrates: Negative"
- "Lactoferrin: 1.1 µg/mL (normal)"
- "Calprotectin: 44 µg/g (normal)"
- "Lysozyme: 727 ng/mL (elevated)"
- "Secretory IgA: 66.9 mg/dL (normal)"
- "SCFAs: within normal ranges"
- "pH: 6.0 (normal)"
- "Occult Blood: Negative"
- "Macroscopic Appearance: Normal (brown, soft)"
- "No pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites detected"
abnormalValues:
- "Lysozyme: 727 ng/mL ( > 500 ng/mL)"
normalValues:
- "Elastase: 280 µg/g ( > 200 µg/g)"
- "Lactoferrin: 1.1 µg/mL ( < 7.3 µg/mL)"
- "Calprotectin: 44 µg/g ( < 80 µg/g)"
- "Secretory IgA: 66.9 mg/dL (30 – 275 mg/dL)"
- "SCFA levels (Acetate, Propionate, Butyrate, Valerate, Total SCFAs)"
- "pH: 6.0 (5.8 – 7.0)"
- "Occult Blood: Negative"
- "Macroscopic Appearance (Color: Brown, Consistency: Soft)"
assessmentSummary:
- "No significant digestive or absorptive issues detected"
- "Normal inflammation and immunology markers except for elevated Lysozyme"
- "Good intestinal health based on SCFA production and normal pH"
- "Comprehensive pathogen screening returned negative results"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient does not exhibit signs of digestive or absorptive dysfunction"
- "Inflammatory markers are within normal ranges except Lysozyme, which suggests a possible mild inflammatory response"
- "Normal immunologic response indicated by Secretory IgA"
- "Intestinal health markers and pathogen profile indicate no apparent infections or significant dysbiosis"
- "Elevated Lysozyme may require follow-up to rule out mild inflammation, potentially due to minor pathogenic activity or other inflammatory sources"
