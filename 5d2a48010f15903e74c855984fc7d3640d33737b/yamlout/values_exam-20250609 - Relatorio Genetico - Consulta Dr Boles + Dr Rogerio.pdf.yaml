results:
- metric: "SLC22A5 Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "c.254_264dupGGCTCGCCACC, p.Ile89GlyfsTer45, Exonic (Frameshift), heterozygous, de novo"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Pathogenic"
  observations: "De novo mutation affecting carnitine transport → less energy available during stress. Action: Supplement Isaac with L-carnitine ± acetyl-carnitine."
- metric: "TRAP1 Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "c.1163G>A, p.Arg388Gln, Exonic (Nonsynonymous SNV), probable splice-site variant, heterozygous"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Probable"
  observations: "Paternal inheritance. Mitochondrial stress protection impaired → more oxidative damage. Action: Support mitochondria with antioxidants (CoQ10, alpha-lipoic acid, NAC)."
- metric: "SCN9A Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "c.2190G>C, p.Trp730Cys, Exonic (Nonsynonymous SNV), heterozygous"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Likely pathogenic"
  observations: "Paternal inheritance. Overactive pain/heat sensors → could trigger meltdowns, pain, poor sleep. Action: Consider sodium channel blockers (topical lidocaine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine)."
- metric: "MED13 Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "c.866A>T, p.Asp289Val, Exonic (Nonsynonymous SNV), heterozygous"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Uncertain"
  observations: "Paternal inheritance. Subtle gene expression regulator → linked to ASD, but not directly actionable. Action: Justifies ongoing neurodevelopmental therapies."
- metric: "MT-ND1 Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "m.3397A>G, p.Met31Val, Exonic (Nonsynonymous SNV), homoplasmic"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Uncertain"
  observations: "Maternal inheritance. Seen in some neurological conditions, likely benign here. Action: No current concern."
- metric: "MT-TT Variant"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "m.15929A>G, tRNA mutation, homoplasmic"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Uncertain"
  observations: "Maternal inheritance. Rare tRNA mutation → might slightly reduce protein production in mitochondria. Action: No direct action; adds to mitochondrial stress."
- metric: "Chromosome 3q Deletion"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "Deletion includes NAALADL2 gene"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "VUS"
  observations: "Paternal inheritance. Deletion includes NAALADL2; not well understood. Action: Monitor; classified as VUS (variant of uncertain significance)."
- metric: "CACNA1A Repeat Contraction"
  material: "DNA"
  result: "Repeat contraction variant"
  result_unit: "N/A"
  reference_range_min: "N/A"
  reference_range_max: "N/A"
  result_status: "Uncertain"
  observations: "Origin unclear. May relate to migraines/ataxia in other cases, unclear relevance for Isaac. Action: No action needed now."
