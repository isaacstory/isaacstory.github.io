assessmentSummary:
- "No significant abnormalities observed"
- "Elevated Transaminase (TGO) could indicate mild liver dysfunction"
- "Overall, the patient appears to be in good health with minor discrepancies"
gptInterpretation:
- "The majority of health markers are within normal ranges indicating stable health"
- "Elevated TGO might warrant further observation for liver function"
- "Continued monitoring and periodic check-ups are recommended"
