requested_by: "Unknown"
metrics:
- "Urinary Organic Acids"
- "Metabolic and Microbial Indicators"
- "Creatinine"
purpose:
- "To evaluate microbial proliferation and metabolic function through organic acid quantification in urine"
resultSummary:
- "Most parameters are within the normal reference range"
- "Some microbial indicators slightly elevated"
abnormalValues:
- "134-hydroxyphenylacetic: 322 (Elevated related to Clostridium species)"
- "HPHPA: 220 (Elevated, associated with Clostridium activity)"
- "Cresol: 84 (Elevated, linked to C. difficile)"
- "3-indol acetic: 140.60 (Elevated due to various microbial activities)"
normalValues:
- "Citramalic Acid: 1.1 (Within range)"
- "5-hydroxy-methyl-2-furoic: 14 (Within range)"
- "Furano-2,5-dicarboxylic: 1.5 (Within range)"
- "Furancarbonylglycine: 0.04 (Within range)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Indicators suggest slight microbial imbalance but overall metabolic processes appear normal."
gptInterpretation:
- "These results suggest the presence of a slight microbial imbalance in the gut, particularly involving Clostridium species."
- "The creatinine adjustment indicates the results are accurate and not significantly affected by recent fluid intake variability."
- "Further clinical correlation is advised to assess gastrointestinal symptoms or dietary factors affecting microbial balance."
