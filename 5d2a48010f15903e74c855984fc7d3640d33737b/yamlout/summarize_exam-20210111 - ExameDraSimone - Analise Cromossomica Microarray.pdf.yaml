metrics:
- "Chromosomal analysis by microarray"
purpose:
- "To identify chromosomal gains or losses"
resultSummary:
- "Sex chromosomes: XY"
- "ISCN: arr[GRCh38] 3q26.31q26.32(175364178_176001139)x1"
- "Type: deletion"
- "Size: 637 kb"
- "Classification: Probably benign"
abnormalValues:
- "637 kb interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 3"
normalValues:
- "No pathogenic chromosomal segments detected"
assessmentSummary:
- "The SNP-array test did not detect any known pathogenic chromosomal segment gains or losses."
- "This result excludes known microdeletion or microduplication syndromes as described in the OMIM and DECIPHER databases."
- "A genomic variant classified as probably benign was identified: a 637 kb interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 3."
- "This deleted segment does not include genes associated with diseases."
- "Similar deletions have been identified in rare individuals in the general population."
gptInterpretation:
- "The exam shows a 637 kb deletion on chromosome 3 which is classified as probably benign."
- "There is no evidence that this deletion causes clinical symptoms."
- "No other chromosomal abnormalities were found."
