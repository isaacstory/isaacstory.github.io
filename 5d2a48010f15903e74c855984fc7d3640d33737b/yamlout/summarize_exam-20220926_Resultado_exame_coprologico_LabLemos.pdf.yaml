metrics:
- "pH"
- "Zonulin"
- "IgA secretory"
- "Lactoferrin"
- "Calprotectin"
- "Alpha-1-antitrypsin"
- "Pancreatic Elastase"
- "Fecal fat"
- "Helicobacter pylori antigen"
- "Blood in stool"
purpose:
- "Evaluate gastrointestinal function"
- "Assess inflammation markers"
- "Identify pathogenic bacteria"
- "Determine presence of occult blood"
resultSummary:

- "Zonulin: 130 ng/mL (Elevated)"
- "IgA Secretory: 342 mg/dL (Elevated)"
- "Lactoferrin: 360 ng/mL (Normal)"
- "Calprotectin: 360 ng/mL (Elevated)"
- "Alpha-1-antitrypsin: 17 mg/dL (Normal)"
- "Pancreatic Elastase: 218 mcg/g (Normal)"
- "Fecal fat: 5% (Elevated)"
- "Helicobacter pylori antigen: Positive"
- "Blood in stool: Negative"
abnormalValues:
- "Zonulin: 130 ng/mL"
- "IgA Secretory: 342 mg/dL"
- "Calprotectin: 360 ng/mL"
- "Fecal fat: 5%"
normalValues:
- "pH: 5.0"
- "Lactoferrin: 360 ng/mL"
- "Alpha-1-antitrypsin: 17 mg/dL"
- "Pancreatic Elastase: 218 mcg/g"
- "Blood in stool: Negative"
assessmentSummary:
- "Increased intestinal permeability indicated by elevated Zonulin"
- "Elevated IgA Secretory suggesting heightened immune response"
- "Elevated Calprotectin indicating inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract"
- "Positive Helicobacter pylori antigen suggesting infection"
gptInterpretation:
- "The elevated zonulin levels suggest increased intestinal permeability, often referred to as 'leaky gut'. This can lead to systemic inflammation and potentially trigger autoimmune responses."
- "The high levels of secretory IgA indicate an active immune response in the gut, possibly due to chronic infection or ongoing exposure to antigens."
- "Elevated calprotectin points towards active inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, which could be from inflammatory bowel disease or another inflammatory condition."
- "The presence of Helicobacter pylori requires medical attention as it is associated with gastritis, ulcers, and potentially gastric cancer."
