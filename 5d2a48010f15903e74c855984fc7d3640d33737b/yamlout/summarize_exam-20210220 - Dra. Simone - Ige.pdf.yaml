title: "IGE, protein S, NSE, Zinc"
material: "blood"
sample_date: "2021-02-20"
requested_by: "Dra Simone Pires"
metrics:
- "IgE Specific for various allergens (Alfa-lactoalbumin, Egg Yolk, Beta-lactoglobulin, Seafood, Cocoa, Beef, Chicken, Casein, Egg White, Soy, Gluten, Milk Proteins, Seeds)"
- "Protein S Functional Determination"
- "Neuronal Specific Enolase (NSE)"
- "Zinc Levels"
purpose:
- "Evaluate allergic sensitizations"
- "Assess protein S functionality in blood"
- "Monitor neuronal-specific activity"
- "Determine zinc blood levels"
resultSummary:
- "All IgE specific allergens measured < 0.10 KU/L (within reference range)"
- "Protein S Functional: 100% (within reference range)"
- "Neuronal Specific Enolase (NSE): 29.38 µg/L (above reference range)"
- "Zinc: 131.38 µg/dL (above reference range)"
abnormalValues:
- "Neuronal Specific Enolase (NSE): 29.38 µg/L (normal < 18.3 µg/L)"
- "Zinc: 131.38 µg/dL (normal 70-120 µg/dL)"
normalValues:
- "All IgE specific allergens measured < 0.10 KU/L"
- "Protein S Functional: 100%"
assessmentSummary:
- "No significant IgE-mediated allergic responses detected"
- "Protein S functionality appears to be normal"
- "Elevated levels of Neuronal Specific Enolase suggest potential neuronal injury or disease"
- "Elevated zinc levels may indicate excessive zinc intake or occupational exposure"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient does not exhibit allergic responses to the tested allergens"
- "Normal protein S levels suggest proper blood coagulation function"
- "Elevated NSE may require further examination to rule out neuronal damage or neuroendocrine tumors"
- "Elevated zinc might need investigation for dietary sources or exposure assessment"
