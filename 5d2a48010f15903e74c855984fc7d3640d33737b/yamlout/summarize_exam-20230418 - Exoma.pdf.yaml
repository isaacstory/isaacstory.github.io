metrics:
- "Gene mutation analysis"
- "Zygosity level"
- "Chromosomal location"
purpose:
- "Identify genetic causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)"
- "Find genetic variants with potential clinical significance"
resultSummary:
- "Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) identified in the MED13 gene"
- "No other genetic variants related to health conditions found"
abnormalValues:
- "Rare genetic variant p.D289V in MED13 gene"
normalValues:
- "No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified"
assessmentSummary:
- "The variant in MED13 is extremely rare and not present in international genomic databases"
- "This variant has unknown clinical significance but is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders"
gptInterpretation:
- "The test identifies a rare variant in a gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting further investigation is needed"
- "Genetic counseling is recommended to correlate these findings with clinical data"
