requested_by: "Dr. Simone Pires"
metrics:
- "IgG antibody levels against Candida albicans"
- "IgG antibody levels against yeasts"
purpose:
- "To assess the presence and level of IgG antibodies against Candida"
- "To evaluate possible yeast infections or overgrowth"
resultSummary:
- "Low reactivity to Candida albicans (4.62)"
- "Non-significant reactivity to yeasts (1.33)"
abnormalValues:
- "None"
normalValues:
- "IgG antibody levels against Candida albicans"
- "IgG antibody levels against yeasts"
assessmentSummary:
- "Elevated IgG antibodies against Candida may suggest past or present overgrowth or infection"
gptInterpretation:
- "The patient shows low levels of IgG antibodies against Candida, which suggests minor exposure or past infection. No significant yeast infection or overgrowth is identified."
