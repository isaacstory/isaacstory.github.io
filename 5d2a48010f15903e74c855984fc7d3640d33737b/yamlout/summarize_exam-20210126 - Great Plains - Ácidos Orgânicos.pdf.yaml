metrics:
- "Organic acids"
- "Nutritional and metabolic profile"
purpose:
- "Assess metabolic and nutritional status"
- "Identify potential biochemical abnormalities"
resultSummary:
- "Elevated 3-methylglutaric and/or 3-methylglutaconic acids indicating impaired leucine metabolism"
- "Elevated succinic acid suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction"
- "Low homovanillic acid (HVA) indicating reduced dopamine metabolism"
- "Elevated fungal metabolites indicating yeast/fungal overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract"
abnormalValues:
- "3-Methylglutaric acid: 30 mmol/mol creatinine (high)"
- "3-Methylglutaconic acid: 32 mmol/mol creatinine (high)"
- "Succinic acid: 45 mmol/mol creatinine (high)"
- "Homovanillic acid (HVA): 6.3 mmol/mol creatinine (low)"
- "5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA): 4.7 mmol/mol creatinine (low)"
- "Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA): 3.0 mmol/mol creatinine (low)"
normalValues:
- "Fumaric acid: 0.85 mmol/mol creatinine (normal)"
- "Citric acid: 232 mmol/mol creatinine (normal)"
- "Pyruvic acid: 4.1 mmol/mol creatinine (normal)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Indicators suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired amino acid metabolism"
- "Low levels of neurotransmitter metabolites suggest reduced neurotransmitter synthesis or increased degradation"
- "Presence of elevated fungal metabolites indicates possible gastrointestinal dysbiosis"
gptInterpretation:
- "Patient may have mitochondrial dysfunction leading to impaired energy production and increased oxidative stress"
- "Low levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites could be associated with neurological and psychological symptoms such as depression or cognitive delays"
- "Gastrointestinal issues, indicated by elevated fungal metabolites, may require antifungal treatment and probiotic supplementation"
