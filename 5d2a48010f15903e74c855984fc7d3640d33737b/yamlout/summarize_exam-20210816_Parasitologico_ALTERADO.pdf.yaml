metrics:
- "Bilirrubin"
- "Degraded Proteins"
- "Total Organic Acids"
- "Ammonia"
- "PH"
- "General characteristics (color, form, consistency, smell, etc.)"
- "Microscopic examination (muscular fibers, starch, crystals, etc.)"
- "Parasitological examination (protozoa, helminths)"
purpose:
- "Evaluate digestive health and function"
- "Check for signs of infections or digestive disorders"
resultSummary:
- "Bilirrubin: Negative"
- "Degraded Proteins: Positive"
- "Total Organic Acids: 15.2 cm3"
- "Ammonia: 4.0 cm3"
- "PH: 6.0"
- "General characteristics: Normal"
- "Microscopic examination: Presence of well-digested muscular fibers, starch, cellulose"
- "Parasitological examination: Absence of protozoa and helminths"
abnormalValues:
- "Degraded Proteins: Positive"
- "PH: 6.0 (Below reference range)"
normalValues:
- "Bilirrubin: Negative"
- "Total Organic Acids: 15.2 cm3"
- "Ammonia: 4.0 cm3"
- "General characteristics: Normal"
- "Absence of protozoa and helminths"
assessmentSummary:
- "Possible protein degradation issues"
- "Slight reduction in PH indicating potential carbohydrate intolerance or fat malabsorption"
gptInterpretation:
- "The presence of degraded proteins and slightly lower PH suggests some digestive inefficiency, potentially related to protein and carbohydrate digestion."
- "Overall, no serious abnormalities were found, but monitoring and possibly dietary adjustments might be needed to address minor issues."
