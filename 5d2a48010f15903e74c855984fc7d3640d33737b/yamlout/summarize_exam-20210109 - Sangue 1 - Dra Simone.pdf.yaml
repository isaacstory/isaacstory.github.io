- "Triglycerides at 145 mg/dL (within reference range)"
- "Prealbumin at 0.21 g/L (within reference range)"
- "Anti-Gliadin IgA and IgG below detection thresholds"

- "Copper at 198.3 µg/dL (above the reference range)"
- "Homocysteine at 7.7 µmol/L (within reference range)"
- "Insulin at 7.3 µUI/mL (within reference range)"
- "HbA1c at 5.0% (Within normal range)"
abnormalValues:
- "CD8% at 15.2% (reference range: 15.7-33.8%)"
- "HDL Cholesterol at 42 mg/dL (reference range: >45 mg/dL)"
- "Copper at 198.3 µg/dL (reference range: 90-190 µg/dL for age group)"
normalValues:
- "CD8 absolute count: 664/mm3 (reference range: 452-1701 /mm3)"
- "Total Cholesterol: 150 mg/dL (reference range: <170 mg/dL)"
- "LDL Cholesterol: 84 mg/dL (reference range: <110 mg/dL)"
- "Triglycerides: 145 mg/dL (reference range: <100 mg/dL)"
- "Prealbumin: 0.21 g/L (reference range: 0.20-0.40 g/L)"
- "Homocysteine: 7.7 µmol/L (reference range: 3.7-13.9 µmol/L)"
- "Insulin: 7.3 µUI/mL (reference range: 2.6-24.9 µUI/mL)"
- "HbA1c: 5.0% (reference range: <5.7%)"
assessmentSummary:
- "Lipid profile generally within normal limits except for low HDL Cholesterol"
- "Normal immune cell (CD8, CD4) counts except for lower percentage of CD8+ T cells"
- "Normal metabolic and hormonal markers including insulin and HbA1c"
- "Elevated copper level"
- "No signs of autoimmune activity or current viral infections"
gptInterpretation:
- "Patient appears to have a generally healthy immune system but may benefit from monitoring due to the low percentage of CD8+ T cells."
- "Elevated copper should be investigated further for potential toxicity or metabolic issues."
- "Low HDL Cholesterol could be a risk factor for cardiovascular issues and might require lifestyle changes or treatment."
- "Normal HbA1c and insulin levels suggest good glycemic control."
- "The absence of autoimmune activity and negative viral detections are reassuring signs."
