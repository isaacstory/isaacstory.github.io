# Current Concerns and Priorities:

## Are hyperactivity and attention difficulties the primary concerns now?

Yes, yes, definitely. Isaac spends the day running back and forth and has a lot of difficulty stopping to pay attention to anything. We think this difficulty in paying attention greatly hinders his learning. While he runs from one side to the other, for example, he runs a lot from the living room to the kitchen, from the kitchen to the living room. He also has a stereotypy where he likes to always hold a ribbon in his hand, waving it and looking at it. I have the impression that he self-regulates with this. He is, in a way, satisfying some need by waving this ribbon. 

We also find it very concerning that he cannot play in a functional way. The activities he enjoys most are physical activities with his body. Activities where he can run, or climb on the couch, or go down the slide, or swing, or stay in weird positions, like upside down on the couch, things like that. So we think that this difficulty in playing functionally also makes it harder for play to be used as a tool for his learning and cognitive development.

## Is communication and verbal development still a priority?

Yes, yes, definitely. Although his speech has improved a bit and he can verbalize things a little more, it's much more in a repetitive way, or when participating in play activities, rather than having true communicative intent. For example, we can't ask him to tell us about something that happened. He can express what he wants in very simple terms - juice, chocolate, tasty food - he can say these very well. Other things, not so much.

## Are there any other new or pressing concerns?

Well, Isaac will turn seven in November, right? We're already in March and we know that at seven years old there's that final neural pruning, so we know we have an important window to try to get the maximum learning and development from him.

# Response to Previous Interventions:

## Were there any interventions that showed lasting improvements beyond sleep and occasional speech gains (e.g., dietary, supplement, behavioral, or biomedical therapies)?

So, last year we did hyperbaric chamber treatment and we noticed that his speaking ability improved during the treatment, but afterwards this improvement did not maintain at the same level after the treatment ended.

Rectal ozone therapy also had a similar effect.

Removing/reducing milk, sugar and gluten from his diet helped his intestines function better. We also noticed a correlation between this and improvement in some test results that apparently have some correlation with fungus in the intestines, and this also correlated with a reduction in the amount of spontaneous laughter he had. He still does it today, but less frequently.

## Any side effects from current supplements or therapies?

Recently we did a protocol called REAC that we had heard good things about, but the effect of REAC was negative for him. He didn't used to scream. During REAC, which was 18 sessions, one per day, we noticed that he would become nervous and a bit unbalanced on the days he had the application. The doctor said this was normal and would pass afterwards. But it didn't pass. The REAC sessions ended three months ago and he continues to be worse than he was before starting REAC. Worse in the sense of being nervous. Every now and then he gets nervous and lets out a very loud scream that startles everyone around because he's nervous. This has been very slowly decreasing over time. But it's still a problem.

# Future Investigations:

## Are there specific areas you want further investigation on (e.g., metabolic, mitochondrial, immune, genetic, gut microbiome)?

Well, this is definitely an area where I need your help.

His genetic tests, as you can see in the history, point to some alterations that I'm not sure if they are conclusive, in terms of indicating a definitive cause for his autism.

He also has a very altered MitoSwab result that you can see there in the history and I don't understand how much this also contributes as a cause of his autism, and how much we should double down on investigating any mitochondrial problems.

And he also has altered IgG tests, I think this measures the amount of antibodies, right? These are tests from 2021, I think from January and September 2021, where the IgG for measles, rubella and mumps is well above the reference value. Again, I'm not a doctor, right? But to me, this is a warning sign for possible complications in terms of creating some autoimmune problem?

# Parental Expectations and Goals:

## Do Isaacâ€™s parents have specific treatment goals in mind (e.g., reducing hyperactivity, improving social engagement, expanding language use)?

The parents believe that reducing hyperactivity and developing communication skills is what will truly unlock Isaac's cognitive evolution so that he can achieve the maximum degree of independence.

## Are they open to trying new biomedical, behavioral, or integrative approaches?

Yes, the parents and I believe that there is a lot of new science being developed and as long as we're not creating any risk of harming the child, there may be alternatives that more traditional doctors would say: "Oh, this has no scientific proof." But since everything is very new, we also know that many things don't have scientific proof YET, because studies are still ongoing and there are different levels of scientific evidence. So we are very aware of this and know that there are many new things available to be tested, with low risk and that are showing good results for many people. So we can't wait for the "pace of science" because those with autism are in a hurry.
