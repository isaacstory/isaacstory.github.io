      <h2>Patient Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Isaac França</li>
        <li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 11/06/2018</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 5 years old</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Diagnosis:</strong> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="clinical-history section">
      <h2>Clinical History</h2>
      <p>Isaac França is a 5-year-old male diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) around the age of 2.5 years. The initial concerns arose when he was approximately 18 months old, as his speech development was delayed, and he showed a lack of response when called by name. He has never developed functional speech and continues to have significant challenges in using spoken language to communicate. While he has a big vocabulary and can sing many different songs, he lacks the ability to use language with the intention to communicate. Recently, there has been some progress, as Isaac has started to verbalize simple words to express basic needs (e.g., chocolate, sleep, juice). Despite these small advances, he remains largely non-verbal and continues to wear diapers.</p>
      <p>Isaac's motor development is strong; he is physically healthy and enjoys running, demonstrating good coordination and strength. However, he exhibits hyperactivity, often struggling to sit still or focus on tasks. Socially, Isaac prefers solitary play and has difficulty engaging with other children or adults. He tends to use toys in a non-functional manner and finds it challenging to participate in shared play activities.</p>

    <div class="treatment-interventions section">
        <h2>Treatment and Interventions</h2>
        <p>Isaac has been undergoing a combination of behavioral therapies and biomedical interventions. His current therapeutic regimen includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dietary Modifications:</strong> Gluten-free, dairy-free, and sugar-free diet, with occasional deviations on gluten and sugar</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Therapies:</strong> Occupational therapy, music therapy, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)</li>
            <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Melatonin, taurine, a multivitamin complex, GABA, and others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notable past interventions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannabidiol (CBD) was attempted but discontinued due to poor tolerance</li>
            <li>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy provided temporary improvement that regressed after treatment stopped</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="current-status section">
      <h2>Current Status</h2>
      <p>Isaac remains in good health. We have an ongoing concern regarding his communication abilities and the impact this has on his learning and development. Despite slow progress, recent improvements in his ability to verbalize basic needs have been encouraging. Isaac continues to receive specialized educational support, including the recent addition of a therapeutic assistant at school, which has shown promise in providing more individualized attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="family-history section">
      <h2>Family History</h2>
      <p>There is a known family history of autism on the paternal side, with one adult cousin diagnosed with ASD. However, given the large family size, this may or may not be directly relevant to Isaac's condition.</p>
