      <h2>Patient Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Isaac França</li>
        <li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 11/06/2018</li>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> 6 years old</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Diagnosis:</strong> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="clinical-history section">
      <h2>Clinical History</h2>
        <p>Isaac França is a 6-year-old male diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) around the age of 2.5 years. Initial concerns arose when he was approximately 18 months old due to delayed speech development and a lack of response when called by name. He has never fully developed functional speech; although he possesses a broad vocabulary and can sing many songs, he often struggles to use language intentionally for communication. Over time, he has shown limited progress in verbalizing simple words to express basic needs, but remains predominantly non-verbal.</p>
        <p>In terms of physical development, Isaac is strong and healthy. Early in life, he enjoyed running and showed good coordination. However, hyperactivity has become more pronounced, significantly affecting his daily functioning. He rarely sits still, constantly running from room to room, frequently holding or waving objects such as ribbons, cloths, or pieces of paper. Additionally, he often jumps on and off the couch, making it hard for him to engage in structured activities, functional play, or even watch short videos. This high level of activity and difficulty sustaining attention greatly concerns his family and therapists, as it impacts his learning and cognitive development.</p>
        <p>Socially, Isaac continues to prefer solitary play and rarely interacts with peers or adults in a meaningful way. He often uses toys in a non-functional manner, and shared play remains limited. Ongoing therapies aim to address his communication barriers, social skills, and hyperactivity.</p>

    <div class="treatment-interventions section">
        <h2>Treatment and Interventions</h2>
        <p>Isaac has been undergoing a combination of behavioral and biomedical interventions. His current therapeutic regimen includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dietary Modifications:</strong> Gluten-free, dairy-free, and sugar-free diet (with occasional deviations on gluten and sugar)</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Therapies:</strong> Occupational therapy, music therapy, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)</li>
            <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Melatonin, taurine, a multivitamin complex, GABA, and others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notable past interventions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannabidiol (CBD) was attempted but discontinued due to poor tolerance</li>
          <li>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy provided temporary improvement, but regressed after treatment ended</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="current-supplements section">
      <h2>Current supplementation (as of 2025-may)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>- Vitamin formula, 5ml after lunch (Vitamin B1 10 mg; B2 5 mg; B5 10 mg; B6 15 mg; Biotin 50 mcg; Zinc 20 mg; Selenium 50 mcg; Chromium 50 mcg; Manganese 0.5 mg; Magnesium ascorbate 300 mg; Betaglucan Plus 200 mg; Hydroxocobalamin 500 mcg; Siliciumax 150 mg; Lithium 50 mcg; Nicotinamide 15 mg)</li>
        <li>- Vitamin D3 3000 IU + Vitamin A 2000 IU + Vitamin E 50 IU + Tocopherol mix 50 mg + Vitamin K2 20 mcg: 5 drops/day</li>
        <li>- L-Theanine 500 mg + GABA 500 mg + Memantine 5 mg + Inositol 500 mg + Citicoline 200 mg + 5-HTP 50 mg: 5ml twice a day (reduce dose if sedation occurs)</li>
        <li>- Methylcobalamin 1000 mcg, 1 drop in the morning and 1 at noon</li>
        <li>- Super Omega 3 liquid (1080mg EPA + 720mg DHA), 5ml once a day</li>
        <li>- Melatonin DUO 2mg, 1 sublingual capsule diluted in a small amount of liquid before bedtime</li>
        <li>- ProSleep 250 mg, try 1 to 2 capsules before bedtime</li>
        <li>- Taurine 500mg, 1 capsule before bedtime</li>
        <li>- Gut permeability formula, 1 scoop 1 x/day mixed with juice or food (Peptan 4.5 g; Taurine 0.5 g; L-Glycine 1000 mg; Glucosamine sulfate 500 mg; Curcumin 95% 0.5 g; Fibregum 2.0 g; MSM 0.5 g; Orthosilicic acid 50 mg)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="current-status section">
      <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <h3>Key Symptoms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pronounced hyperactivity: constant running.</li>
          <li>Severe attention deficit and lack of focus.</li>
          <li>Oral and motor stereotypies (e.g., sticking tongue out, waving ribbons).</li>
          <li>Episodic insomnia.</li>
          <li>Mood instability: crying or laughing without apparent cause.</li>
          <li>Recent onset of screaming.</li>
          <li>Low muscle tone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At present, the biggest concern regarding Isaac's development is his pronounced hyperactivity and lack of attention. He spends much of his day running indoors, moving rapidly from the living room to the kitchen and back, often waving items in his hand (ribbons, cloth, paper). Parents are worried that this persistent lack of attention interferes with cognitive development, as he cannot engage in learning opportunities or structured play.</p>
        <p>On a more positive note, Isaac has been sleeping better. Previously, he would often wake around 3 or 4 AM and stay awake for the remainder of the night, leading to sleep deprivation for both him and his mother. Now, these disruptions less frequent (1-2 times a week). His bowel movements have also improved; whereas they used to alternate between pasty and hard, they are currently more consistently firm. Additionally, he used to laugh spontaneously without apparent reason throughout the day. This inappropriate laughter has become considerably less frequent.</p>
        <p>Isaac continues to receive specialized educational support, including a therapeutic assistant at school, which has helped to provide more individualized attention. Nonetheless, his parents and clinical team remain focused on addressing his hyperactivity, improving attention, and encouraging more functional communication.</p>
